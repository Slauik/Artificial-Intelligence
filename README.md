# Artificial-Intelligence
Olympiad, the programming task of the company "SKB Kontur" in 2017.

To run the program first you need to unzip the archive "cvarc.rar" and open the file start.bat

2) 2 bot (one inactive), an open map; 
3) 2 bots (one inactive), closed map;
You can also choose another map by changing the seed number in method "Connect".
